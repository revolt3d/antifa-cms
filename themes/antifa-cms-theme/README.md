# antifa-cms theme

This theme is bare bones. It does very little.

Here's what you can do with it, which might be enough for you, it often is for me.

1. Create and publish stories
2. View published stories
3. View list of published stories

While I absolutely use this theme on my websites because I'm a nut about having really fast web page loads, with extreme low hosting costs. The more you do, the more you spend. For me, I just use antifa-cms to publish stories that I write. It's what people used to call "blogging." I just call it publishing.

You absolutely can use this theme for your website and it will probably work just fine. However, if you think this theme is to simplistic, too ugly, too whatever, you have some options. 

1. You can build your own theme from the ground up.
2. Modify an existing theme, like this one, to satisfy your needs. 

If you do want to modify this theme or create your own, because antifa-cms is built on Pico CMS, you can find the documentation about themes on this [Pico CMS website](https://picocms.org/docs/#themes).

Don't forget that with antifa-cms, you are only limited by your imagination, and what is currently possible on the Internet right now. Your website doesn't have to be basic af like my websites are, be you.
