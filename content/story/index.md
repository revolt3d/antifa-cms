This is an example for how to list stories using antifa-cms. You can view the markdown for this stories list [here](https://github.com/revolt3d/antifa-cms/blob/main/content/story/index.md?plain=1). The real work is done in the stories template in the theme. You can view that [here](https://github.com/revolt3d/antifa-cms/blob/main/themes/antifa-cms-theme/stories.twig). This is part of the antifa-cms tutorial available [here](https://github.com/revolt3d/antifa-cms/blob/main/README.md).
