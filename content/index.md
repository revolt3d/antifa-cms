If you are reading this on your local computer, that probably means you successfully made it through my tutorial for [antia-cms](https://github.com/revolt3d/antifa-cms).

Now that it's working, continue the tutorial to learn how to add your own content to antifa-cms. It's really easy, but rather than duplicate the instructions here, continue with the tutorial. Check out the section on creating your own content.

Thank you for considering antifa-cms. I do not profit from this in any way. I created antifa-cms to share my knowledge about building websites with people who may have less technical skills than myself, but want to publish their ideas online. Using antifa-cms, you are free to say whatever you want to. If you slander someone and get sued, that's on you.

To see other features of antifa-cms, [check out the stories](story) page that lists the stories currently published by antifa-cms.
